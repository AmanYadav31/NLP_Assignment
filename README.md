## NLP_Assignment

# How to Run
1) Clone repo/download code.
2) Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Change the path to the dataset in lines 81 and 82 of the code. For example, the lines in my code are:

pos_text_file = r'C:\Users\AMAN YADAV\Downloads\NLP Assignment\rt-polarity.pos'
neg_text_file = r'C:\Users\AMAN YADAV\Downloads\NLP Assignment\rt-polarity.neg'

The paths are configured for my machine. Please change them to match the locations of the rt-polarity.pos and rt-polarity.neg files on your system.

4) Run: python 2101032_nlpAssign.py
